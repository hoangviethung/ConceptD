											| ConceptD was born out of a belief that designers achieve their best work when they reach their own definition of perfection. Independent research discovered that 15% of gaming device users never install games, and that 50% use both gaming and creative software. This is why we have created a brand that specifically meets the needs of creators. The brand launch is not the destination but the beginning of a journey as we continue to listen to creatorsâ€™ needs.
